# NoTitle
A simple title block builder for my program notes so I don't have to do it by hand. Node branch of "PyTitle"

Requirements: clipboardy

To use:
1 - From the command line: node notitle.js
2 - Type in the Title that you want to be put in an asterisk block.
3 - Hit enter when done. You will get a preview of the text that is copied to clipboard. 
    Close the window and paste from your clipboard (ctrl-c on windows, command-c on Mac) to paste
    into your text editor of choice.
